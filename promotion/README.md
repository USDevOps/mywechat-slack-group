**Motivate Active Slack Members To Promote The Group In Their Networks.**

_Attention: avoiding doing that, if people don't feel comfortable and suitable._

1. **Use slack group in your daily work**. It can be useful for more people, only after it's useful to yourself.

Example:

  [Denny] I personally use #today-learnings for personal daily review. #aws for my AWS questions.

2. **Ping #suggestions**, if you can't find what you need or something makes you uncomfortable.

3. **Post real slack discussions to LinkedIn**. And ask your connections to Join.

Example:
